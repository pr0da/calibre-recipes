# calibre-recipes

This project is created to convert open source materials to ebook format (`.mobi` or `.epub`) with the help of [Calibre Recipes](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/news.html). 

It does not include any generated `.mobi` or `.epub` files and only includes the `.recipe` file for Calibre.
